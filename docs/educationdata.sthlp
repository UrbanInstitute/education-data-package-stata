every institution in the IPEDS universe. This includes name, address, city,
state, zip code, and various URL links to the institution's home page,
admissions, financial aid offices, and the net price calculator. Identifies
institutions as currently active and institutions that participate in Title IV
federal financial aid programs for which IPEDS is mandatory. It also includes
variables derived from the Institutional Characteristics survey, such as
control and level of institution, highest level and highest degree offered and
Carnegie classifications.

{bf:"college ipeds institutional-characteristics"}: This endpoint contains
data on program and award level offerings, control and affiliation of
institution. It also contains information on special learning opportunities,

admissions considerations for the undergraduate selection process. SAT and ACT
test scores are included for institutions that require test scores for
admission. These data are applicable for institutions that do not have an open
admissions policy for entering first-time students. Writing scores for both SAT
and ACT are no longer collected. The possible values for the admission
consideration variables have changed from prior data. "Do not know" is no
longer an option and "considered but not required" was added.

{bf:"college ipeds academic-year-tuition"}: This endpoint contains data on
tuition and fees for institutions that offer primarily academic programs.

{bf:"college ipeds academic-year-tuition-prof-program"}: This endpoint

occupational programs.

{bf:"college ipeds enrollment-full-time-equivalent"}: This endpoint contains
data on instructional activity measured in total credit and/or contact hours
delivered by institutions during a 12-month period. The credit hour and contact
hour activity data are used to derive 12-month full-time equivalent (FTE)
enrollments for both undergraduate and graduate levels. The graduate level does
not include credit hours for doctoral professional practice students.
Institutions can choose to accept the derived FTE or report their own FTE. Both
reported and estimated/derived FTE are available in this data table for 2003
and later. In addition, the reported FTE of doctoral professional practice
students are also included. These data are only available at the undergraduate,
graduate, and first professional level.

{bf:"college ipeds fall-enrollment race sex"}: This endpoint contains the
number of students enrolled in the fall by race, sex, full-time/part-time
status, and level of study. For undergraduates, this is further broken down by
degree-seeking/nonâ€“degree-seeking, and degree-seeking is broken down by
class level. Institutions with traditional academic year calendar systems
(semester, quarter, trimester, or 4-1-4) report their enrollment as of October
15 or the official fall reporting date of the institution. Institutions with
calendar systems that differ by program or allow continuous enrollment report
students who are enrolled at any time between August 1 and October 31.
Available levels of study are undergraduate, graduate, first-professional
(through 2008 only), and postbaccalaureate (through 1998 only).

{bf:"college ipeds fall-enrollment age sex"}: This endpoint contains the
number of students enrolled in the fall by age categories, sex,
full-time/part-time status, and level of study. Institutions with traditional
academic year calendar systems (semester, quarter, trimester, or 4-1-4) report
their enrollment as of October 15 or the official fall reporting date of the
institution. Institutions with calendar systems that differ by program or allow
continuous enrollment report students who are enrolled at any time between
August 1 and October 31. Submission of enrollment by age categories is optional
in even-numbered years. Available levels of study are undergraduate, graduate,
and first-professional (through 2008 only); in 2000, only undergraduate data
are available.

{bf:"college ipeds fall-enrollment residence"}: This endpoint contains the
number of first-time freshmen by state of residence, along with data on the
number who graduated from high school the previous year. Institutions with
traditional academic year calendar systems (i.e., semester, quarter, trimester,
or 4-1-4) report their enrollment as of October 15 or the institution's
official fall reporting date. Institutions with calendar systems that differ by
program or allow continuous enrollment report students that are enrolled at any
time between August 1 and October 31. Submission of enrollment of first-time
undergraduate students by residency is mandatory in even-numbered years and
optional in odd-numbered years.

{bf:"college ipeds enrollment-headcount"}: This endpoint contains the
unduplicated head count of students enrolled over a 12-month period for both
undergraduate and graduate levels. These enrollment data are particularly
valuable for institutions that use non-traditional calendar systems and offer
short-term programs. Because this enrollment measure encompasses an entire
year, it provides a more complete picture of the number of students these
schools serve. Counts are available by level of study, sex, and race/ethnicity.

{bf:"college ipeds fall-retention"}: The first-year retention rate data
measures the percentage of first-year students who persisted in or completed
their educational program a year later. This is provided for full-time and
part-time students.

{bf:"college ipeds finance"}: This endpoint contains institutional finance
data, including institutional revenue by source, scholarships, expenditures by
functional and natural classifications, endowments, assets and liabilities, and
pensions. A user guide to these data can be found {browse "https://www.urban.org/research/publication/ipeds-finance-user-guide":here}.

{bf:"college ipeds student-faculty-ratio"}: Student-to-faculty ratio is
defined as total FTE students not in graduate or professional programs divided
by total FTE instructional staff not teaching in graduate or professional
programs. All data on this file is applicable only to institutions with
undergraduate students.

{bf:"college ipeds sfa-grants-and-net-price"}: This endpoint contains data

{bf:"college ipeds sfa-ftft"}: This endpoint contains data on total
first-time, full-time degree-seeking students receiving different types of aid.

{bf:"college ipeds grad-rates"}: This endpoint contains the graduation rate
status as of August 31, at the end of the academic year, for the cohort of
full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduates, by race
and sex. Data for four-year institutions include the number of bachelor's
degreeâ€“seeking students who enrolled six academic years earlier, the
number of bachelor's degreeâ€“seeking students who completed any degree or
certificate within 150 percent of normal time, the number who completed a
bachelor's degree within 100, 125 or 150 percent on normal time, and the number
of bachelor's degreeâ€“seeking students who transferred out. Data for
students seeking a degree or certificate other than a bachelor's degree are
also included for four-year institutions. Data for two-year institutions
include the number of full-time, first-time students who enrolled three
academic years earlier, the number of students who completed any degree or
certificate within 100 or 150 percent of normal time and the number of students
who transferred out. The number of students who completed a degree or
certificate within 100 percent of normal time is not available by race and sex.

{bf:"college ipeds grad-rates-200pct"}: This endpoint contains the
graduation rate status as of August 31, at the end of the academic year, for
the cohort of full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking
undergraduates. Data for four-year institutions include the number of
bachelor's degreeâ€“seeking students who enrolled eight academic years
earlier, the number of bachelor's degreeâ€“seeking students who completed a
bachelor's degree within 100, 150 or 200 percent on normal time. Data for less
than four-year institutions include the number of full-time, first-time
students who enrolled four academic years earlier, the number of students who
completed any degree or certificate within 100, 150, or 200 percent of normal
time.

{bf:"college ipeds grad-rates-pell"}: This endpoint contains the graduation
rate status as of August 31, at the end of the academic year, for three
subcohorts of full-time, first-time degree- or certificate-seeking
undergraduates. The three subcohorts are students who received a Pell grant,
students who received a subsidized Stafford loan and did not receive a Pell
grant, and students who did not receive either a Pell grant or Stafford loan.
In four-year institutions each of the subcohorts will include the number of
bachelor's degreeâ€“seeking students who enrolled six academic years
earlier, the number of bachelor's degreeâ€“seeking students who completed
any degree or certificate within 150 percent of normal time, the number who
completed a bachelor's degree within 150 percent on normal time. Data for
students seeking a degree or certificate other than a bachelor's degree are
also included for four-year institutions. Data for two-year and less-than
two-year institutions include the number of full-time, first-time students who
enrolled three academic years earlier and the number of students who completed
any degree or certificate 150 percent of normal time.

{bf:"college ipeds outcome-measures"}: This endpoint contains award and
enrollment data from degree-granting institutions on undergraduate cohorts that
entered an institution eight academic years ago. The two years of data
currently available have slightly different definitions for cohorts and
information available. In 2015, there is information on four cohorts collected
at two points in time: six academic years and eight academic years after entry.
The four cohorts of degree- or certificate-seeking undergraduates are
full-time, first-time entering; part-time, first-time entering; full-time,
non-first-time entering; and part-time, non-first-time entering. In 2016, there
is information on eight cohorts collected at three points in time: four
academic years, six academic years, and eight academic years after entry. The
eight cohorts are the four cohorts described for 2015, but for each, they
further disaggregate by Pell recipients and non-Pell recipients. Additionally,
in 2016, they collect more detailed information about the types of awards
completed, such as a certificate, Associate's degree, or Bachelor's degree.
Finally, the cohort definitions between the two years change. In 2015, the
completion rate at 6 and 8 years after entry uses the adjusted cohort from the
corresponding year after entry as the denominator, whereas in 2016, one
adjusted cohort is used as the denominator in all rates, regardless of years
after entry.

{bf:"college ipeds completers"}: This endpoint contains the number of
students who completed any degree or certificate by race and ethnicity and
gender.

{bf:"college ipeds completions-cip-2"}: This endpoint contains the number of
awards by type of program, level of award (certificate or degree), first or
second major, and by race and ethnicity and gender. Type of program is
categorized according to the 2-digit Classification of Instructional Programs
(CIP), a detailed coding system for postsecondary instructional programs, which
groups the 6-digit CIPs into their families. There are some exceptions, such as
law and medical fields, which were reported as 6-digits by the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System. IPEDS reported data at the 2-digit CIP
level until 2001; after that, the 6-digit CIP data were collapsed to the
2-digit level.

{bf:"college ipeds completions-cip-6"}: This endpoint contains the number of
awards by type of program, level of award (certificate or degree), first or
second major, and by race and ethnicity and gender. Type of program is
categorized according to the 6-digit Classification of Instructional Programs
(CIP), a detailed coding system for postsecondary instructional programs, which
changes over time.

{bf:"college ipeds academic-libraries"}: This endpoint contains information
on the academic institution's electronic and physical library, collections,
expenditures, and services. These data are available only for degree-granting
institutions, and expenditure data are available only for institutions with
total expenditures above $100,000.

{bf:"college ipeds salaries-instructional-staff"}: This endpoint contains
the number of staff, total salary outlays and average salaries of full-time,
nonmedical, instructional staff by academic rank, contract length, and sex.

{bf:"college ipeds salaries-noninstructional-staff"}: This endpoint contains
the number and salary outlays for full-time, nonmedical, noninstructional staff
by occupational category.

{bf:"college scorecard institutional-characteristics"}: This endpoint
contains institutional characteristics for each college or university,
primarily including flags for minority-serving institutions. To avoid
duplication, we exclude data that College Scorecard sourced from IPEDS. For
these data, you can see the other Institutional Characteristics and Directory
endpoints. Notably, most of the information contained in this endpoint can be
found in 2016 and aside from identification and year, only predominant degree
awarded is available in other years.

{bf:"college scorecard student-characteristics aid-applicants"}: This
endpoint contains detailed data on student aid applicants in each institution,
including income level, dependency status, number of college students sent Free
Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms to, and other student
demographics. These data are produced for rolling two-year pooled entry cohorts
by the National Student Loan Data System (e.g., the 1997 data represent
information from two cohorts, assessment year 1996â€“97 and assessment year
1997â€“98).

{bf:"college scorecard student-characteristics home-neighborhood"}: This
endpoint contains detailed demographic information on cohorts of students,
based on when they enroll in college. These data describe the population
residing in the students' home zip codes, including information about race,
education level, nationality, poverty status, household income, and employment
status. The US Treasury Department calculated these data elements using census
data for two-year pooled cohorts at each institution (e.g., the 2005 file
includes the 2004â€“05 and 2005â€“06 earnings cohorts). Home zip codes
are determined using information from when the student first applied for
financial aid.

{bf:"college scorecard earnings"}: This endpoint contains information on
earnings for former students, by their pooled entry cohort and institution.
This information may be available 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after the pooled
cohort entered college, but availability varies by cohort. For example, the
assessment year (AY) 1996â€“97 and AY 1997â€“98 pooled cohort has
earnings data available 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 years after entry, but the AY
2001-02 and AY 2002â€“03 pooled cohort only has earnings data 10 years
after entry and the AY 2003â€“04 and AY 2004â€“05 pooled cohort only
has earnings data 8 years after entry.

{bf:"college scorecard default"}: This endpoint contains information on the
default rates by cohort for two or three years after students entered
repayment. The two-year default rate is available from 1996 to 2012, and the
three-year default rate is available starting in 2011. The cohorts are those
that entered repayment two or three years before the year of measurement. For
example, those who entered repayment between October 1, 2012, and September 30,
2013 (which we identify as cohort 2012, but corresponds with fiscal year 2013),
have their three-year default rate measured as of September 30, 2015 (year
2015).

{bf:"college scorecard repayment"}: This endpoint contains detailed
repayment data by pooled cohort and institution. These data are also available
by subgroup, including dependency status, Pell recipiency, first-generation
status, sex, and income level. These repayment rates are measured one, three,
five, and seven years after the cohort enters repayment. For example the
one-year repayment rate for fiscal year (FY) 2008 and FY 2009 cohorts
(cohort_year 2008) are measured in FY 2009 and FY 2010 (year 2009),
respectively.

{bf:"college nhgis census-2010"}: This endpoint contains geographic
variables corresponding to 2010 Census geographies for each IPEDS institution.
Geographies are merged on by latitude and longitude when available; when
unavailable, latitudes and longitudes were obtained from address information
using Urban's geocoder. The geocoder uses StreetMap Premium from Esri to
perform accurate offline geocoding. Geocode accuracy variables indicate the
degree of precision of this geocoding. Additional information on the match
accuracy can be found {browse "https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/geocode/api-reference/geocoding-service-output.htm":here}.
Geographies for older years of data or low-accuracy geocode matches should be
used with caution.

{bf:"college nhgis census-2000"}: This endpoint contains geographic
variables corresponding to 2000 Census geographies for each IPEDS institution.
Geographies are merged on by latitude and longitude when available; when
unavailable, latitudes and longitudes were obtained from address information

{bf:"college fsa financial-responsibility"}: This endpoint contains
financial responsibility composites scores for for-profit and nonprofit
institutions. These scores gauge an institution's financial health and help the
Department of Education assess an institution's financial responsibility
compliance. The scores are based on a primary reserve ratio, an equity ratio,
and a net income ratio. They are collected at the OPEID level, but we report
them at the UNITID level in order to facilitate merging with IPEDS data.

{bf:"college fsa grants"}: This endpoint contains data on Title IV grant
volume and total recipients by institution and year. These data are collected
by the Office of Federal Student Aid at the OPEID level, and we have provided
them at the unit ID level. Where these differ, amounts have been allocated to
each institution based on full-time equivalent students. To avoid
double-counting, users should use the _unitid variables; _opeid variables are
the original amounts and will lead to double-counting unless only one record
per OPEID year is kept.

{bf:"college fsa loans"}: This endpoint contains data on Title IV loan
volume and total recipients by institution and year. These data are collected
by the Office of Federal Student Aid at the OPEID level, and we have provided
them at the unit ID level. Where these differ, amounts have been allocated to

double-counting, users should use the _unitid variables; _opeid variables are
the original amounts and will lead to double-counting unless only one record
per OPEID year is kept.

{bf:"college fsa campus-based-volume"}: This endpoint contains data on Title
IV campus-based programs volume and total recipients by institution and year.
These data are collected by the Office of Federal Student Aid at the OPEID
level, and we have provided them at the unit ID level. Where these differ,
amounts have been allocated to each institution based on full-time equivalent
students. To avoid double-counting, users should use the _unitid variables;
_opeid variables are the original amounts and will lead to double-counting
unless only one record per OPEID year is kept.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Command Options}

The {bf:educationdata {opt csv}} option allows you to request CSV files instead of 
downloading data from the API directly. This is particularly useful in saving you time 
when you wish to download a large extract. Note that this option requires you
to have read and write privileges to the current working directory. If you do not have 
these priveleges, change to a working directory where you do. For example,

. cd D:/Users/[your username here]/Documents

The {bf:educationdata} command takes two options for only collecting a subset
of the dataset you request:

1. {bf:{opt sub:set(str)}}: Specifies a single subset or list of subsets of the dataset
along as many valid variables as the dataset contains. Multiple subset variables must be 
separated by a space (e.g., sub(variable1=value1 variable2=value2)), and multiple
subset values for a variable must either take the form of a continuous list separated
by a colon, or a list of values separated by a comma. Note that there can be no spaces
between the variable, the equals sign, and the value (e.g., sub(variable1=value1), not
sub(variable1 = value1)).

To be concrete, while not a complete list of options, subset conditions may take the 
form of sub(variable1=value1), sub(variable1=value1,value2), 
sub(variable1=value1:value5), sub(variable1=value1 variable2=value1,value4,value5,value6),
or sub(variable1=value4:value6 variable2=value1,value2), to name a few. Lists 
separated by a colon and a comma in a single variable are {bf:not supported}. For 
example, sub(variable1=value1:value3,value5) is {bf:not allowed}. 

To be even more concrete, valid values might include sub(year=2011), 
sub(year=2010:2015), sub(year=2012:2016 fips=12), etc. if year and fips were 
valid variables in the dataset specified after the "using" statement.

For {bf:grade}, the options include "pk", "k", 1 through 12, 13, 14 (adult education),
15, (ungraded), and 99 (total).

Optionally, you may substitute "-1" for "pk" and "0" for "k".

For {bf:level_of_study}, the options include "undergraduate","graduate",
"first-professional", "post-baccalaureate", and 99 (total).

All variables follow a similar pattern to {bf:level_of_study}. {bf:In general}, the code 
99 indicates all categories combined, or "totals only". For example, race=99 or sex=99 
indicates all races or all genders, while grade=99 indicates total for all grades. 
Using the 99 filter can save time for those who only wish to request totals, and don't 
need by race, by grade, or by gender breakdowns.

{marker columns}{...}
2. {bf:{opt col:umns(str)}}: Specifies the variables you would like to select, if you only
want a subset of variables. So, you might say:

. educationdata using "college ipeds directory", col(unitid year)

{bf:In addition}, the {bf:{opt clear:}} option clears the current dataset in memory before
saving the new dataset. For example,

. educationdata using "college ipeds directory", col(unitid year) clear 

{bf:And the {opt meta:data}} option allows reads in the variable names, variable labels, 
and value labels, without reading in the data. For example,

. educationdata using "college ipeds directory", meta

The {bf:{opt cache}} is for situations in which the data have been updated recently
on the portal, but you are still seeing the older data when you make a call. Typically,
the technical team will clear the cache on the server, so this will not be an issue. We
provide this option in case you are still seeing old data but think you should be seeing
new data. We do not recommend using this option in any other case, as it will lead to 
slower data download times.

. educationdata using "college ipeds directory", cache

{bf:The {opt clear}} option clears existing datasets from memory before
reading in the data from the Education Data Portal. For example,

. educationdata using "college ipeds directory", clear

{bf:And finally the {opt summaries}} option provides statistical summaries of a dataset using 
user-defined summary statistics and variables. The arguments are structured as 
"summaries ([statistic method] [variable of interest] by [grouping variable])", where 
the first argument indicates the summary statistic to be retrieved. Valid statistics include: 
"avg", "sum", "count", "median", "min", "max", "stddev", and "variance". The second argument is 
the variable to run the summary statistic on, and the third indicates the grouping variable to use. 
If there are multiple grouping variables, please separate them by one whitespace. 
For example, 

. educationdata using "school ccd enrollment", summaries(sum enrollment by fips race) sub(year=2000) 

This command takes the "schools/ccd/enrollment" endpoint, retrieves the sum of school enrollment 
by fips code, and filters to year 2000. 

Filters can also be applied to summary statistics using the "sub" command.  The arguments are structured as 
"sub(variable=value))", where multiple filters are separated by "&".
For example,

. educationdata using "school crdc ap-ib-enrollment", summaries(sum enrl_IB by crdc_id) sub(year=2017&fips=36)

This command takes the "schools/crdc/ap-ib-enrollment" endpoint, retrieves the sum of IB enrollment by Office of 
Civil Rights school ID in 2017 for the state of New York.
